# BeerPi

Simple python program to control a fridge with a temperature sensor, cooling and heating. It is used to control fermenation of beer.

There is no intelligence in this script, it simply listens and publishes on an MQTT server. The actual logic is handled by another program, in this case home assistant.

## Hardware:
- Relay module (4CH, only using 2 channels)
- DS18B20 (temperature sensor)
- Raspberry pi zero w

## Connecting

The Pi has the following GPIO connections:
- Relay channel 1 (cooling): 20
- Relay channel 2 (heating): 21
- DS18B20 on the one wire interface: pin 4

## Setup OS
Simply flash a raspbian or something to a SD card, to make sure it boots headless:
- Create a wpa_supplicant.conf: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md
- add an ssh file: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md
- Activate the one-wire inteface (boot.cfg): https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/02/enable-1-wire-interface-raspberry-pi/
- clone the repo
- install the dependencies
- copy the systemd file to /lib/systemd/system/beerpi.service
